# 🚀 Simple Blockchain Project

Welcome to your first **Blockchain** project! This is a basic, educational implementation of a blockchain written in **Python**, designed to help you understand the core concepts behind distributed ledgers, blocks, hashing, and proof of work.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project simulates a basic blockchain that:

- Allows you to create a chain of blocks
- Implements basic proof-of-work (mining)
- Uses SHA-256 hashing for data integrity
- Accepts transactions and includes them in blocks

This is a **learning-focused** project, not meant for production use or financial transactions.

## 🛠️ Features

- Create a genesis block
- Add new blocks to the chain
- Hash block data securely using SHA-256
- Perform basic proof-of-work (PoW)
- View the entire blockchain
- Validate the integrity of the chain

## 📦 Installation
